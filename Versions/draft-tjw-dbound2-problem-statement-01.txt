                Domain Boundaries 2.0 Problem Statement
                 draft-tjw-dbound2-problem-statement-01

Abstract

   Internet clients attempt to make inferences about the administrative
   relationship based on domain names.  Currently it is not possible to
   confirm organizational boundaries in the DNS.  Current mitigation
   strategies have there own issues.  This memo attempts to outline
   these issues.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   Working off of the earlier problem statement
   [I-D.sullivan-dbound-problem-statement], which we still consider
   valid.  Various Internet protocols and applications require some
   mechanism for determining whether two domain names have some
   relation.

   The concept of an administrative boundary is by definition not
   present in the DNS.  Relying on the DNS to divine administrative
   structure thus renders such solutions unreliable and unnecessarily
   constrained.  For example, confirming or dismissing a relationship
   between two domain names based on the existence of a zone cut or
   common ancestry is often unfounded, and the notion of an upward "tree
   walk" as a search mechanism is, therefore, unacceptable.

   Currently, the most well known solution in existence is the Public
   Suffix List (PSL).  The PSL is maintained by and is kept current by
   volunteers on a best-effort basis.  It contains a list of points in
   the hierarchical namespace at which registrations take place, and is
   used to identify the boundary between so-called "public" names (below
   which registrations can occur, such as ".com" or ".org.uk") and the
   private names (organizational names) that domain registrars create
   within them.  When this list is inaccurate, it exposes a deviation
   from reality that degrades service to some and can be exploited by
   others.  As the PSL is the de-facto resource, and as there is not a
   more comprehensive, alternative solution for relationship
   identification, the PSL has often been misused to accomplish things
   beyond its capabilities.  For example, there is no way to confirm the
   relationship between two domain names -- the PSL may only signal that

   there is or is not a public boundary between the two.  Additionally,
   there are questions about the scalability, central management, and
   third-party management of the PSL as it currently exists.

   Applications and organizations impose policies and procedures that
   create additional structure in their use of domain names.  This
   creates many possible relationships that are not evident in the names
   themselves or in the operational, public representation of the names.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  DNS terminology is as described in
   [RFC8499].

3.  Simplifying the list of possible Use Cases

   A main topic that immediately arises from this discussion is the
   replacement of the Public Suffix List (PSL).  Currently, this
   document is not looking at the problem space with regards to it.

   From the previous problem statement, the one use case which

3.1.  HTTP State management cookies

   *  Cookies that have the same-site in browsers.  For example:

      allowing www.example.com to respond with a set-cookie for
      example.com so *.example.com will work.

      not allowing example1.co.uk to respond with a set-cookie for
      example2.co.uk.

   *  CA wildcards: it's OK to sign a cert for *.example.co.uk or
      *.example.com but not for .co.uk or *.com.

   Other applications and organizations impose policies and procedures
   that create additional structure to express many possible
   relationships, such as in first-party-sets or IDN-UA.  These are not
   always evident in the names themselves, and any solutions developed
   here may or may not suit these existing policies and procedures.

3.2.  Service Boundaries in shared cloud environments

   A public cloud provider may have a large number of boundaries they
   need to publish.  Taking an example resource within an example
   service, that resource might have a domain name that follows the
   below pattern (2LD may vary):

   "resource-id.cluster-id.servicename.region-name.example.com"

   With the current PSL, the need may exist to publish 1+ records per
   region per service.  If there are many services across many more
   regions, these updates do not scale.  Putting this information into
   DNS allows us to publish records, without manual updates.

3.3.  Network resource boundaries in shared cloud environments

   Network suffixes and resouces that are public, but not routable or
   resolvable outside of one's network (public-like-PSL, not public-
   like-pool).  A good example is an internal zone within a virtual
   private clouds (VPCs).

   VPCs are resources customers can create, which reserves them a
   logically-isolated portion of AWS's network.  Within each VPC, there
   is a VPC-internal DNS zone which contains DNS records for resources
   within the VPC (suffix zone of "compute.internal" or equivalent),
   which is separated per-VPC.  Every network interface in a VPC will
   have an associated per-interface record in this zone (for VPCs using
   a default configuration).

   These customers may chose to peer their VPC with another customer,
   and these VPC-internal zone would now have multiple different
   customers operating within it.

   *  Linking domains together

   In terms of specific use cases, within the realm of email there is a
   desire to link an arbitrary fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to the
   organizational domain name (at some point in the namespace above it),
   in order to identify a deterministic location where some sort of
   statement of policy regarding that FQDN can be found.

   There is another growing use case within organizations that need to
   identify relationships between different FQDNs, but also different
   top level domains.  However, there is also desire to reliably
   identify relationships outside of the realm and constraints of the
   namespace tree.
